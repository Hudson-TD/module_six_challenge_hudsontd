Description:

The goal of this challenge was to create a responsive API driven web app that displays locational weather data along with a five day forecast. This was achieved with the Open Weather API and fetch requests to obtain specific pieces of data. Once the data was collected I used JavaScript with jQuery to dynamically update the CSS and HTML to display the information on the page. I decided to challenge myself a bit further by using Tailwind CSS for the first time on this challenge. Learning this third party API has prepped me to use it in upcoming projects as an alternative to Bootstrap.
